[This project][code-enforcement-archive] mirrors and archives the [Current Open Cases](http://www.lbds.info/neighborhood_services/code_enforcement/current_open_cases.asp) of Long Beach Development Services' code enforcement records. We opted for JSON as a more convenient format for consuming and analyzing code enforcement records, and git in order to maintain a historical record including changes over time to each case record.

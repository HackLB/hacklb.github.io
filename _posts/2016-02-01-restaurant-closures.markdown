[This project][garage-sale-archive] mirrors and archives the [restaurant closures list](http://www.longbeach.gov/health/inspections-and-reporting/inspections/restaurant-closures/) which the [Long Beach Health Department](http://www.longbeach.gov/health) publishes. We opted for JSON as a more convenient format for consuming and analyzing restaurant closure records, and git in order to maintain a historical record including changes over time to each case record.

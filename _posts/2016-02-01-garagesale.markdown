This project [mirrors and archives][garage-sale-archive] records from the [City of Long Beach Garage Sale Permit](https://wwwbitprod1.longbeach.gov/GarageSalePermit/SearchByDate.aspx) database. 

We opted for JSON as a more convenient format for consuming and analyzing garage sale records, and git in order to maintain a historical record including changes over time. This repo groups records by address, so you can easily see the history of garage sales for each address.

                    <p>The HackLB Data Liberation Front is inspired by Google's team of the same name. Our primary goal is "to make it easier to for technologists and citizens alike to access city data", initially through two main activities:</p>

                    <ul>
                    <li>Conversion of existing information resources into modern and accessible data formats. For instance, converting and mirroring Long Beach's open GIS datasets into GeoJSON format.</li>

                    <li>Development, aggregation, and hosting of RESTful APIs for a variety of city-related information resources.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The DLF is primarily concerned with making public datasets more accessible, rather than the analysis, visualization and other further interaction with the data.
